            The data types in JavaScript looks simple and useless but having an insight on how they work is essential. Data types help to provide a better understanding of the language and its behaviour. Today, with the help of this tutorial, we will cover one of the most important concepts that we need to learn to master JavaScript. If you are already familiar with any other programming language, you must already know some of the data types along with their use. Even if you are new to programming, don’t worry, this tutorial covers it all. Like every programming language (C/C++ and Java), JavaScript also has two basic data types. They are:

Primitive Datatypes
Non-primitive (reference) Datatypes
Since JavaScript is a dynamic language, you don’t need to specify the type of the variable. It is dynamically used by the JavaScript Engine. The var keyword specifies the type of data in the variable like a number, string, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>JavaScript Datatypes (Primitive)</h2>
        <p>
            All datatypes except Objects define immutable values i.e. these values are incapable of changing. These values are “primitive values”. JavaScript has seven types of primitive data types, based on the type of data we are storing in the variable:<br />
</p>
<p>
            Number <br />
            BigInt<br />
            Boolean<br />
            String<br />
            Null<br />
            Undefined<br />
            Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6)<br /></p>
           
        </p>
        

        <h2> JavaScript Datatypes (Non-Primitive) </h2>
        <p>
            The non-primitive datatypes in JavaScript include objects, arrays, and functions. Each of these data types is a different topic in itself. So you will learn all about them thoroughly in our later tutorials. For now, just try to understand the basics about them and the reason why these are present in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Types are as below : <br />
            Objects<br />
            Array<br />
            Functions<br />
